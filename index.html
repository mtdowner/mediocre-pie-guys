      <p class="welcome">Welcome to Mediocre Pie Guys!<br>
      <p>You could have chosen any of the 807 pizza restaurants in the area, but you chose us. For that, we guarantee 100% satisfaction.
      <p>Guaranteed.</p>
      <p>Our mission is providing the biggest and largest pizza in the city. Shooting for the entire country is just unrealistic, so we settled. It's your orders that keep us alive and flipping pizzas in all sorts of styles because you call the shots. You're a shot-caller.</p>
      
      <p>Go shoot those shots. We'll be waiting.</p>
